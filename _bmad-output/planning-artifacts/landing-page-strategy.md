# Landing Page Strategy — 1st Class Chimney & Air Duct

## 1. Overall architecture for separate service landers

Create one "master" layout and then specialize it per service:

- /chimney-cleaning
- /chimney-repair
- /air-duct-cleaning (later)
- /dryer-vent-cleaning (later)

Each keeps the same structural sections but changes:

- Hero headline + subheadline + first trust bullet
- Problem/symptom bullets
- Service cards order and labels
- Safety/education focus
- FAQ set and examples
- Review snippets and before/after emphasis

This gives you maximum message match while keeping design/dev overhead low.

## 2. Chimney cleaning lander – section focus

Keep the wireframe but "lean" everything toward cleaning:

- Hero: "Chimney Cleaning Near You" angle, creosote/fire-risk language, "Call Now for Chimney Cleaning Availability."
- Problems: all bullets are "dirty chimney" symptoms (smoke, soot, smell, last cleaned > 1 year).
- Services grid:
  - Primary card: Chimney Cleaning
  - Secondary: Chimney Inspection, Dryer Vent Cleaning, Air Duct Cleaning (smaller "also available").
- Safety/education: creosote, chimney fire risk, recommended cleaning frequency.
- FAQs: frequency, mess, appointment length, what's included in cleaning.
- Reviews: highlight "chimney cleaning," "fireplace," "no mess," "smoke problem solved."

Primary CTA copy everywhere: "Schedule Chimney Cleaning" / "Call for Chimney Cleaning Availability."

---

## 3. Chimney repair lander – section focus

Same skeleton, but tuned to "problem/diagnosis/repair" mindset:

- Hero: "Chimney Repair & Restoration" angle; talk leaks, cracks, safety issues, failed home inspections.
- Problems: water stains, cracked crown, crumbling brick/mortar, bad caps/flashing, inspection reports.
- Services grid:
  - Primary: Chimney Inspection & Diagnosis
  - Masonry Repair & Repointing
  - Crown & Cap Replacement
  - Waterproofing & Leak Repair
  - (Cleaning only mentioned as part of inspection/repair as needed).
- Safety/education: structural/water intrusion, interior damage, why early repair saves money.
- FAQs: home inspection findings, photos/video of damage, written estimates, timelines, seasonality.
- Reviews: highlight "leaks fixed," "cracks repaired," "passed inspection," "explained everything clearly."

Primary CTA copy: "Schedule Chimney Inspection" / "Call About Chimney Repair."

## 4. Google Ads mapping to these landers

Campaign/ad group → landing page:

- Campaign: Chimney Cleaning
  - Ad groups: "chimney cleaning near me," "chimney sweeping," "chimney sweep cost" → /chimney-cleaning

- Campaign: Chimney Repair
  - Ad groups: "chimney repair," "chimney leak repair," "chimney masonry repair," "chimney crown repair" → /chimney-repair

On each lander:

- Mirror the main keyword in H1, subheadline, and at least one H2.
- Use service-specific extensions (callout, structured snippets) that match the page copy.

---

## 5. "Combo" lander for cleaning + inspection (optional)

For some markets, you might want a hybrid "Chimney Cleaning & Inspection" lander, especially for seasonal promos.

Adjust hero:

- H1: "Chimney Cleaning & Safety Inspection — One Visit, Double Protection"
- Sub: "We remove creosote and perform a full visual inspection to help reduce chimney fire risk and spot issues early."

Wireframe tweaks:

- Problems: mix of "dirty chimney" symptoms and "haven't had an inspection in years / failed home inspection."
- Services: two main cards only – "Chimney Cleaning" and "Chimney Safety Inspection," with repair positioned as "recommended if needed after inspection."
- Safety: combine fire-risk and "catch problems early before they become expensive repairs."

Map "chimney inspection" / "chimney inspection and cleaning" ad groups to this lander.
